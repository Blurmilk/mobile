                    This is my recent work of a social media platform. It is a translation from a virtual space to a physical architectural space
                    <br>I researched on these nine platforms and translate them into architectural spaces in terms of the interpersonal relationship of each platform
                    <br>I want to use it to discuss how to reconstruct our public discourse environment.
                    <br>there are different kinds of communities.
                    different community programs
                    they were in order and then became blend with each other 
                    
                    the architectures we see today are spatially ordered, for example, we will first go to a hall and then to a corridor and finally to a room
                    
                    but here, I want people to feel lost, they don't know what they're going to encounter next, they may come out of a petting zoo and immediately encounter a concert, or they may just finish a salon and immediately encounter a concert. or they may have just finished a salon and then encounter a pornographic film set, or they may have just finished a debate with someone and encounter a discussion about Rimbaud's poetry on the other side
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here you will meet anything at random and what surround you could be anything, in such a lost and confused scene, you are surrounded by all kinds of voices and opinions and actions, and I want to use it to create a visual and auditory and intellectual impact, when you are in the presence of these activities, is it possible to let all these different, and things you have never seen before to break your stereotype
